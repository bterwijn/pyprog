# Python Programming for Minor Computational Science

## Syllabus<br><small>Fall 2022</small>

We assume no prior programming experience. You can learn quite a bit still, if you have some informal prior experience or if you've done just a few assignments in Python. If you have done a full 6 credit course in Python this course is not for you.

## Teacher and assistants

Your teachers in class are Quinten van der Post and Jasper Timmer. They will be on your side during class and might respond to e-mail inquiries. Course design and examination is done by Martijn Stegeman, who will not be in class but can be reached with the rest of the team at <help@mprog.nl>.

## Assignments and final grade

Learning to programming is done through lots of practice. Almost all of the work in this course is making programming assignments. These are the main components:

1. Book exercises (10%). The book contains exercises you may do to support your understanding of the reading materials. Making and submitting exercises will be part of your final grade. Your answers are checked for completeness and correctness.

2. Programming assignment solutions (20%). Your solutions for the assignments are part of the final grade. The assignments will be assessed on correctness, not on other qualities. Submitting correct assignments automatically yields points for this part of the grade.

3. Individual assignment quality (70%). Every week you will take one or two correct programs of the previous week and thoroughly review it with another student. You can then make it even better and re-submit it. These programs will be assessed on quality (you will receive detailed instructions).

4. Exam (0%). The exam will not count in your final grade but you must pass it to be able to pass the course.

To get a final grade for the course you will need to, at a minimum:

-  Submit all programming assignments that are individually assessed (item 3).
-  Have attended all but 1 of the Tuesday lectures.
-  During the first two weeks, Fridays are also mandatory to attend.
-  Pass the exam.

When all is set, the final grade will be calculated according to the percentages above.

## Asking questions

During this course you will enlist the help from teaching assistants and classmates. There are a few options for asking questions. Which one is best depends on the kind of question or problem you have.

**Classmates:** thinking together about the theory and the assignments.

* work together in class or at other hours
* talking through the exact requirements of the assignments
* discussing the inner workings of Python and how to apply to problems
* analyzing examples and bugs

**Teaching assistants:** help with programming from very experienced assistants.

* getting help during class hours
* you don't know where to start or have a brain-breaking bug
* you have trouble thinking of a solution
* you need someone to talk to about the assignment

**Laptop helpdesk:** help with your computer.

* your computer broke down
* you have trouble installing everything correctly
* available every weekday 10-16h in room B1.19A @ Science Park 904
* after three weeks they're not regularly available

**E-mail:** talk to the teachers for personal arrangements.

* help with planning the course in your personal schedule
* talking through big troubles with the course
* other official business
* administrative issues after the course
* e-mail <help@mprog.nl> and mention the Python for Data Processing course


## Deadlines

For most weeks there are two deadlines.

1. The deadline for **completing** weekly assignments and exercises. They do not count towards your grade after this deadline, whatever happens. If you don't meet the deadline you should probably still try to finish the assignments in order to get the practice that you need.

    - Exercises need to be complete and mostly correct to get credit. They will be checked by hand.
    - Programming assignments need to be fully correct and will be automatically checked, so if you're on time you could correct and re-submit your solution.
    - No need to write tidy and nice code, because that's what the second deadline is for.

2. The deadline for the **improved** version of one or two weekly programs. During the lecture you will do a code review with another student, and you will improve your solution on various aspects. The teacher will assign the programs that have to be reviewed. If you weren't able to finish one of these programs, the teacher will decide which programs you will review. After submitting the improved versions, these will graded by the staff. Note that the improved version still has to be correct as it was before!

|             | completion deadline | improvement deadline |
|:------------|:--------------------|:---------------------|
| Module 1    | Fri  9 Sep  17:59   | -                    |
| Module 2    | Fri 16 Sep  17:59   | Tue 20 Sep  18:59    |
| Module 3    | Fri 23 Sep  17:59   | Tue 27 Sep  18:59    |
| Module 4    | Fri 30 Sep  17:59   | Tue  4 Okt  18:59    |
| Module 5    | Fri  7 Okt  17:59   | Tue 11 Okt  18:59    |
| Module 6    | Fri 14 Okt  17:59   | -                    |
| Module 7    | Fri 21 Okt  17:59   | -                    |

### Illness and getting back on track

When you get ill please report it as soon as you can by e-mail. You don't have to make elaborate explanations or excuses, but simply tell what's going on. Keeping in touch is the most important thing you can do, and it is required in case an exception would have to be made.

- When you're ill for just a few days you can still catch up. Does it prevent you from finishing the last assignment of the week? No worries, you may miss a point or two but you can still continue without too much trouble. Do catch up because otherwise you don't get enough practice.

- Do you have a medical emergency and gone for maybe a full week? Then it's time to talk to the teacher and see if it's reasonable to continue the course and how to do that. Factors to take into account are how many courses you're doing, how well you're progressing in the course, etc.

- Are you lagging behind and not meeting deadlines anymore? Maybe you have too much to do or you've lost your focus. It's important to discuss such problems as early as possible. Your teacher can provide information about consequences or help assess your course progress.

In all cases feel free to send an e-mail to <help@mprog.nl> and mention Python for Data Processing.

## Assignment grades

The points for the **improved** solutions that you make on Tuesdays are assigned through the schedule below, with a maximum of 6 points per week. For each week, we provide a number of "aspects" that are the primary influence of the points you get (but not the only influence).
These aspects concern *code quality*, about which you'll learn more during the code reviews on Tuesdays.

6. exceptionally good quality based on a well thought-out design
5. very good quality overall, with limited room for improvement
4. solid quality on all aspects, with room for improvement
3. just enough attention for all of the aspects, with a lot of room for improvement
2. some attention for a part of the aspects, not enough for all
1. insufficient observable attention to code quality aspects
{: start="6" reversed=""}

Want to do well (4 points)? Study the aspects that we provide and actively participate in the code review. This should yield a lot of input for improving your programs.

Want to score very high (6 points)? In that case you'll need to study not only our materials but find external sources about writing good Python code and make a very good design that fits the solution in particular.

For the **Virus** assignment points are assigned as follows:

- 1 punt voor stap 1 en 2 (mits gehouden aan de genoemde regel-limieten)
- 2 punten voor stap 3, 4 en 5 (mits gehouden aan de genoemde regel-limieten)
- 2 punten voor een werkende simulatie
- 1 punt voor een interessante eigen grafiek

For the assignments in module 7 points are assigned as follows:

- 1 punt voor de opdracht **Lisp** mits goede doctests en aanwezige type hints
- 2 punten voor de opdracht **Figuren** mits goede doctests en aanwezige type hints
- 3 punten voor de opdracht **Knapsack** mits goede doctests en aanwezige type hints

## Book

For building your Python knowledge (in a particular way) we use the book  **Practical Programming**, third edition, by Paul Gries. You can buy it as PDF via <https://pragprog.com/titles/gwpy3/practical-programming-third-edition/>.

## Exam

During the exam you'll build a number of small programs based on the problems that we propose. You'll do this on your own computer by leveraging the experience you have with building small and large programs during the course. To get used to the particular form of testing, you get weekly exam exercises in class.

## Doing your own work

This course's philosophy on academic honesty is best stated as "be reasonable." The course recognizes that interactions with classmates and others can facilitate mastery of the course's material. However, there remains a line between enlisting the help of another and submitting the work of another. This policy characterizes both sides of that line.

The essence of all work that you submit to this course must be your own (unless explicitly stated otherwise). Collaboration on problem sets is not permitted except to the extent that you may ask classmates and others for help so long as that help does not reduce to another doing your work for you. Generally speaking, when asking for help, you may show your code to others, but you may not view theirs, so long as you and they respect this policy's other constraints. Collaboration on the course's test and quiz is not permitted at all.

Below are rules of thumb that (inexhaustively) characterize acts that the course considers reasonable and not reasonable. If in doubt as to whether some act is reasonable, do not commit it until you solicit and receive approval in writing from the course's heads. Acts considered not reasonable by the course are handled harshly.

By the way, the text of this section was copied (!) from the course Scienctific Programming 1 by  Simon Pauw and adapted from the course CS50 by David Malan. We use the text with permission under a Creative Commons license.

### Reasonable

- Communicating with classmates about problem sets' problems in English (or some other spoken language).

- Discussing the course's material with others in order to understand it better.

- Helping a classmate identify a bug in his or her code at office hours, elsewhere, or even online, as by viewing, compiling, or running his or her code, even on your own computer.

- Incorporating a few lines of code that you find online or elsewhere into your own code, provided that those lines are not themselves solutions to assigned problems and that you cite the lines' origins.

- Reviewing past semesters' quizzes and solutions thereto.

- Sending or showing code that you've written to someone, possibly a classmate, so that he or she might help you identify and fix a bug.

- Sharing a few lines of your own code online so that others might help you identify and fix a bug.

- Turning to the course's heads for help or receiving help from the course's heads during the quiz or test.

- Turning to the web or elsewhere for instruction beyond the course's own, for references, and for solutions to technical difficulties, but not for outright solutions to problem set's problems or your own final project.

- Whiteboarding solutions to problem sets with others using diagrams or pseudocode but not actual code.

- Working with (and even paying) a tutor to help you with the course, provided the tutor does not do your work for you.

### Not Reasonable

- Accessing a solution to some problem prior to (re-)submitting your own.

- Asking a classmate to see his or her solution to a problem set's problem before (re-)submitting your own.

- Decompiling, de-obfuscating, or disassembling the staff's solutions to problem sets.

- Failing to cite (as with comments) the origins of code or techniques that you discover outside of the course's own lessons and integrate into your own work, even while respecting this policy's other constraints.

- Giving or showing to a classmate a solution to a problem set's problem when it is he or she, and not you, who is struggling to solve it.

- Looking at another individual's work during the test or quiz.

- Paying or offering to pay an individual for work that you may submit as (part of) your own.

- Providing or making available solutions to problem sets to individuals who might take this course in the future.

- Searching for or soliciting outright solutions to problem sets online or elsewhere.

- Splitting a problem set's workload with another individual and combining your work.

- Submitting (after possibly modifying) the work of another individual beyond the few lines allowed herein.

- Submitting the same or similar work to this course that you have submitted or will submit to another.

- Submitting work to this course that you intend to use outside of the course (e.g., for a job) without prior approval from the course's heads.

- Turning to humans (besides the course's heads) for help or receiving help from humans (besides the course's heads) during the quiz or test.

- Viewing another's solution to a problem set's problem and basing your own solution on it.
