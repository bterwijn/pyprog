# Decisions

It's time to make some difficult decisions; but fortunately you can leave these to the computer. This week is all about **conditionals**, that enable you to process multiple different scenarios in a program. The programs you are going to write will all contain such conditional constructs.

At the same time you will be writing small **tests** for your functions, so you can show that your functions work correctly for many scenarios. And finally, we take time to study the different **methods** that come with Python. In the long term, such methods will save you a lot of programming time, although they will keep you quite busy in the coming weeks.

## Important topics for this week

1. How to work with True and False
2. How to use `if`s to make decisions
3. How to import modules
4. How to have your code tested automatically
5. How methods work
6. Which standard string-methods are available

## How to study

1. Take the book, read it well and mark anything that's hard to immediately understand
2. Do the exercises at the end of the chapter, using them to understand the text; it will take time
3. Go to the tutorial at the beginning of the week to understand what is expected of you
4. Set quite a bit time apart to work on the programming assignments
5. Always ask for help when you get stuck, even if you think your question is too easy for others
