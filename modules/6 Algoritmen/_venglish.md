# Algorithms

This module is all about algorithms, and specifically two aspects. On one hand you will learn how to develop an algorithm and what you need to take into account when doing that. On the other hand you will get to know a couple of "standard algorithms" for sorting and searching. These standard algorithms are so generally applicable that we can write them in pseudocode and then implement each in a arbitrary programming language to use in the real world. And whichever programming language you choose, the algorithm's properties will be the same. Finally, you will take a good look at comprehensions in Python, which you can use to express some operations in a very compact fashion.

## Important topics for this week

1. Getting to know 2 search algorithms
2. Getting to know 4 sorting algorithms
3. Implementing algorithms from pseudocode
4. Using list comprehensions to write compact code
5. Testing strategies for random functions

## How to study

1. Take the book, read it well and mark anything that's hard to immediately understand
2. Do the exercises at the end of the chapter, using them to understand the text; it will take time
3. Go to the tutorial at the beginning of the week to understand what is expected of you
4. Set quite a bit time apart to work on the programming assignments
5. Always ask for help when you get stuck, even if you think your question is too easy for others
