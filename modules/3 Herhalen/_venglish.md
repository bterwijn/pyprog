# Repetition and lists

Let's get started with **repetition** in code, using loops. Together with **sequence** and **conditions** we have all the ingredients we need to specify program logic. You will find these three elements in many programming languages, so once you get the hang of them, you will have come quite far already.

Next to that we will consider **lists**. Lists afford you a place to store data of variable size. You are no longer obliged to create a name for each separate piece of information, but instead you can store a complete collection under a single name. Some code can even be expressed much more efficiently using lists and loops. But more on that later.

## Important topics for this week

1. How to store data in lists
2. How to manipulate (parts of) lists
3. Which standard-methods are available for lists
4. How to use loops to analyse lists
5. Which other patterns are available for working with loops

## How to study

1. Take the book, read it well and mark anything that's hard to immediately understand
2. Do the exercises at the end of the chapter, using them to understand the text; it will take time
3. Go to the tutorial at the beginning of the week to understand what is expected of you
4. Set quite a bit time apart to work on the programming assignments
5. Always ask for help when you get stuck, even if you think your question is too easy for others
