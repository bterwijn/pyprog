# Data processing

Let's get going with some typical applications. The assignments in this module focus on the use of data structures and data files. Data structures are using in programs for storing data in computer memory, in order to be able to efficiently process and retrieve those. Data files are used for permanent storage on harddisks or "in the cloud". Such files have all kinds of formats (ways of arranging data), some of which you will need to process manually because Python does not handle the format well.

## Important topics for this week

1. Writing and reading from files
2. Using collection types
3. What you can build using collection types
4. The CSV format

## How to study

1. Take the book, read it well and mark anything that's hard to immediately understand
2. Do the exercises at the end of the chapter, using them to understand the text; it will take time
3. Go to the tutorial at the beginning of the week to understand what is expected of you
4. Set quite a bit time apart to work on the programming assignments
5. Always ask for help when you get stuck, even if you think your question is too easy for others
