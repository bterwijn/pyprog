# Variables and functions

Alright, it's time to get programming! We'll be doing that using the book **Practical Programming**. You will be puzzling on real programming problems from the very beginning, but we will also build your knowledge of the ideas that are the foundation of programming. This week it's your goal to understand what a variable is and how to work with variables in programs.

For students with some prior programming experience it'll seem that the course starts very slowly. And in a way it does: this week we do not allow any `if`, `while` or `for` in programs. But at the same time, please do study closely the **way of programming** that we aim to teach you in this course. It may be a bit different from what you're used to. If you're really very experienced, then please pay attention to the "Function Design Recipe" from the book that's going to play a significant role in this course and our way of programming.

## Important topics for this week

1. Understand how variables work
2. What kind of calculations you can do
3. What built-in functions are available in Python
4. How you can design your own functions
5. How you can build a complete program
6. What basic string operations are available

## How to study

1. Take the book, read it well and mark anything that's hard to immediately understand
2. Do the exercises at the end of the chapter, using them to understand the text; it will take time
3. Go to the tutorial at the beginning of the week to understand what is expected of you
4. Set quite a bit time apart to work on the programming assignments
5. Always ask for help when you get stuck, even if you think your question is too easy for others
