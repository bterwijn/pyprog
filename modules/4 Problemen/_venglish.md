# Problem solving

This week we will dive into solving larger programming problems. The assignments have considerably more parts than before. Study the given code and your final solution in order to deeply understand how to divide problems (and solutions) into smaller parts.

Hence, the technical focus of this week is on **functions**. These are the building blocks that help you keep track of all moving parts. Each function should get a distinct name within the context of the program, which will help you to jump between the different parts without having to understand every detail of every function at once. You will also get an opportunity to define additional functions in your solutions.

## Important topics for this week

1. How to build a program from an idea for a solution
2. How to refine your ideas for solutions step-by-step
3. How multiple functions work together and share information
4. Keeping track of what's going on in a large program

## How to study

1. Set quite a bit time apart to work on the programming assignments
2. Always ask for help when you get stuck, even if you think your question is too easy for others
