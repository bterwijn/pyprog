# Code review: Rechthoeken & Wachtwoord

Your code review will focus on a number of **aspects**. These aspects will also be used when assessing your programs for a grade, so using them for the code review may help you get a decent grade.

Note that you should not look at someone else's code if you have not implemented that program yourself, especially if the deadline has not passed yet (we designed the course in such a way that this is unlikely, by scheduling the code reviews after the deadline). 

Check with your teacher before starting the code review. Normally, you should get a fresh partner each week and your teacher will coordinate this.

## Aspects

These are the aspects for this module. Take time to thoroughly read the explanations and examples, and understand everything well.

- [Doctests](/quality/doctests)
- [Typing](/quality/typing)
- [Formatting](/quality/formatting)
- [Comments](/quality/comments)

## Stappenplan

1.  Read through all the aspect pages and discuss with your partner and the teacher if you have any questions (20 minutes).
1.  Read through your partner's solutions, without starting discussions. Take notes for yourself (10 minutes).
1.  Exchange feedback verbally and discuss ways to make each program better. Consider how you yourself will be improving your programs (10 minutes per program).
    * Do not pass on a written list of suggested improvements, but really discuss everything.
1.  Improve your solutions. Do not do a complete overhaul of your programs but try to make them incrementally better using small changes (30--60 minutes).
    * Do not copy your partner's solution design; this takes the "improvement" too far and may lead to suspicions of plagiarism.
1.  [Submit your revised solutions here](/reviews/m2/revised).
1.  Later, you will receive some written feedback from the teacher or assistants that help you focus your attention during the next code review.
