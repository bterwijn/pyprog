# Revise your own code

You have now received feedback from your partner and discussed the fine points. You have made a list of things you'd like to change.

You must answer the following questions to show that you've followed a structured process for improving your programs. If you do not answer them your programs will be awarded 0 points.

1.  Now make those changes in your code. Summarize in the next box the things that you changed in response to the feedback that you got from your partner:

    <textarea name="form[changes_review]" rows="8" required></textarea>

2.  Also make note of any things that you changed not as much in response to the feedback, but changes that you thought of while working on your code:

    <textarea name="form[changes_adhoc]" rows="8" required></textarea>

4.  What **kind** of changes did you make and What did you **not** change in response to the reviews, and why?

    <textarea name="form[not_changed]" rows="3" required></textarea>

Now save your changed file, make sure that it still works correctly, review your answers above, and then submit it below.
