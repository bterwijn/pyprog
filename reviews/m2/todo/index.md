# Discuss feedback and plan changes

After you have studied your partner's code, you are ready to meet up and discuss the feedback. Do not just exchange to-do lists but try to have a fruitful discussion.

1.  Just to be sure: who are you exchanging feedback with?

    <input name="form[partner]" type="text" required>

2.  Take turns in discussing your and your partner's code. Provide your feedback verbally instead of just giving the list that you made in the previous step. Answer each other's questions to better understand the feedback.

3.  When it's your turn to **receive** feedback, make note of things you'd like to change in your code to make it better. Write these down here:

    <textarea name="form[todo_list]" rows="8" markdown="0" required>- item 1</textarea>

4.  It's fine to disagree, so feel free not to change everything that your partner has suggested. In the end, you decide how to improve your code. But: be curious! If you disagree, ask each other questions. Now make not of anything that you have already decided not to change:

    <textarea name="form[not_changed]" rows="3" required></textarea>

5.  Submit your notes by using the button below. Before you do, copy-paste your notes to have your own copy!
