# Code reviews

The goal of code reviews is to learn about **code quality** and the ways that different people navigate code, how they read and understand it, and about techniques to make code "better".

You will be performing code reviews with classmates, preferably a different person each time. The reviews take place during the tutorials so your teachers and assistants kan observe and participate.

After class you will take an hour or so to fully clean up the code using the feedback that you wrote down during the review. And then you can re-submit your programs one more time, after which they will be assessed by your teaching assistant.
